# Movie Insights & Recommender System 🎬

This project uses the [MovieLens 100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) to perform data analysis and build a basic user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system using `pandas`.

### 🔍 Features:
- Movie rating analysis
- Director & genre insights
- User behavior trends
- Occupation and age-based preferences
- User-user similarity analysis
- Movie recommender using correlation

### 🛠 Tools:
- Python 🐍
- Pandas

### 📁 Data:
The dataset is from the **MovieLens 100k** benchmark dataset and includes:
- User ratings (`u.data`)
- Movie metadata (`u.item`)
- User info (`u.user`)

### 📌 Future Ideas:
- Add content-based filtering
- Visualize trends with Seaborn or Matplotlib
- Build a simple web app with Streamlit
